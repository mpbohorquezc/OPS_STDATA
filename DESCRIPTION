Description: Spatial functional data analysis is an alternative approach to spatio-temporal modeling when the curves are time series 
varying spatially. Specifically, functional geostatistics allows to carry out optimal spatial prediction of the whole curve at unsampled
sites. Along with the developments in functional geostatistics, the framework of the optimal spatial sampling designs has been extended. 
This package is concerned with functional kriging, functional cokriging and optimal sampling designs for spatial prediction of functional
data.
